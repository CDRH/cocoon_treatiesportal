<a href="http://treatiesportal.unl.edu/earlytreaties/"><img src="images/smallpic_treaties.jpg" alt="" width="60" height="70" class="imgright" /></a>

<p>The Oklahoma State University Library’s <em><a href="http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/">Indian Affairs:  Laws and Treaties</a></em> Internet site was developed to provide a digital  collection of the final texts of 366 of the 375 American Indian treaties  recognized by the United States Department of State.  The remaining nine documents are provided in  this compilation, to complement the Oklahoma   State resource.</p>



<h1 class="index"><a href="http://treatiesportal.unl.edu/treatylexicon/">You say <em>cranberry</em> and I say <em>cramberry</em>, let's call the whole thing off: A lexicon of the recognized American Indian treaties</a></h1>
<a href="http://treatiesportal.unl.edu/treatylexicon/"><img src="images/smallpic_lex.jpg" alt="" width="60" height="70" border="2" class="imgright" /></a>

<p>Two lexicon corpora of 375 acknowledged American Indian treaties &#8212; one made from those transactions created with the federal government (N = 368), and another from those documents formed during the earlier British occupation (N = 7) &#8212; were generated with TokenX, a text visualization  and analysis tool.  Resulting frequency tables for these families of instruments are included, along with commentary on these laws of the land.</p>

</a></h1>

<p align="left"><a href="http://kappler.unl.edu"><img src="images/smallpic_kappler.jpg" alt="" width="60" height="70" border="2" class="imgright" /></a>Charles J. Kappler (1868&#8211;1946) is known primarily for  his compilation <em>Indian Affairs: Laws and  Treaties</em>.  His contributions as an  employee of the federal government, his role as an attorney specializing in  federal Indian law, and his influence on the development of this jurisprudence also  warrant recognition.  These and other  aspects of his life are presented to demonstrate the wide range of his  accomplishments.</p>

<p align="left"><a href="http://treatiesportal.unl.edu/treatyoffortlaramie1851/"><img src="images/smallpic_laramie.jpg" alt="Fort Laramie" width="60" height="70" border="2" class="imgright" /></a>The <em>Treaty of Fort Laramie with Sioux, etc., 1851</em> was an important                      transaction formed by the federal government with a number of prominent American                      Indian tribes of the Great Plains. Its creation and provisions were a                      demonstration of the growing need for less animosity among the tribes                      themselves, in part to yield increased security for an ever-growing flow of                      settlers into the western United States who traversed in the process the tribes'                      historical lands. However, over the years, a true version of the final                      transaction — reflecting intervention by the Senate after the original                      signing — has never been published. A proposed correct text is                      presented here.</p>

summer and fall of 1861, the Confederate States of America created a 
series of treaties with the tribes in Indian Territory.  These 
transactions were recorded in <i>The Statutes at Large of the Provisional 
Government of the Confederate States of America</i> as the law of the 
land, just as similar federal transactions appeared in the U.S. <i>Statutes</i>.  
The texts of those nine instruments – and their <i>Statutes</i> page

The so-called <em>Okmulgee Constitution</em> was created to provide a model for a full-fledged Indian state to replace the Territory.  Fourteen variants of that document and of a revised rendition were examined in this study, in terms of their variability as quantified by Levenshtein's edit distance algorithm.</p>

<p align="left"><a href="http://treatiesportal.unl.edu/annualregister1763/"><img src="images/annualregister.jpg" alt="" width="60" height="70" border="2" class="imgright" /></a>King George III's <em>Royal Proclamation of 1763</em> provided an operational definition of "Indian country" in North America and set guidelines for the administration of, and inherent sovereignty within, those tribal lands. The effects of these declarations shaped the evolution of Indian affairs in both Canada and the United States; their influence has endured to this day. The texts of variants of that pronouncement &#8211; among editions of <em>The Annual Register</em> and related publications &#8211; are analyzed with Levenshtein's edit distance algorithm.</p>

<p align="left"><a href="http://treatiesportal.unl.edu/forcedconvergence/"><img src="images/forcedconvergence.jpg" alt="" width="60" height="70" border="2" class="imgright" /></a>The <em>Okmulgee Constitution</em>, created in the Creek capital of the Indian Territory in
December 1870, provided a model for a new full-fledged and federally supported
Indian state to replace the Territory. In a previous study, the variants of that
document's text from the official and unofficial record were examined through
the application of Levenshtein's edit distance algorithm. This analysis considers
the similarity of the 1870 <em>Constitution</em> and a revision from 1875 through a series
of forced convergence maneuvers that more closely aligned the texts of these two
already highly correlated instruments. The Levenshtein procedure was employed to
quantify this integration.</p>

tribes of Indians that were specifically enumerated prior to the preparation of the 1764
Plan for the future management of Indian affairs. That Board of Trade policy reassigned
the responsibility for Indian affairs to the imperial government, rather than leaving it to be mediated by the individual colonies. Fourteen variants of those lists, from official and public sources, were compared with Levenshtein’s edit distance algorithm to assess similarity and provenance.</p>

<p align="left"><a href="http://treatiesportal.unl.edu/waitangi1840/"><img src="images/waitangi.jpg" alt="" width="60" height="70" border="2" class="imgright" /></a>The British, in their worldwide program of colonization, consummated treaties with the
indigenous peoples of North America, Africa, Asia, and the Far East and Pacific in a
process to administer these acquisitions. <em>The Treaty of Waitangi, 1840</em> is the primary
document illustrating this behavior in New Zealand but, over time, variants of this
important instrument have appeared. A text analysis of forty-three of these renditions
was performed by applying Levenshtein’s edit distance algorithm.</p>

  <p align="left"><a href="http://treatiesportal.unl.edu/mayflower/"><img src="images/mayflower.jpg" alt="" width="60" height="70" border="2" class="imgright" /></a>Variants of the 1620 <em>Mayflower Compact</em> frequently excluded the names of the forty-one signatories of that accord, yet for those instruments that furnished this list, the spellings were anything but consistent. This variance was also evident in the few references to the appellations of the <em>Mayflower</em> participants found in the 1621 <em>Conference and Agreement Between Plymouth Colony and Massasoit, Wampanoag Sachem</em>. In particular, Levenshtein edit distance analyses assessed these <em>Compact</em> name disparities and the texts of that manifesto, and examined the provenance of its later renditions.  A strong correlation between observed pairs of text and signatory list errors was also found.</p>

  <p align="left"><a href="http://treatiesportal.unl.edu/serialset/"><img src="images/serialset.jpg" alt="" width="60" height="70" border="2" class="imgright" /></a>In his <em>Guide to American Indian Documents in the Congressional Serial Set: 1817-1899</em>, Steven L. Johnson enumerated twenty-seven document collections in the <em>American State Papers: Indian Affairs</em> that were not also published, in whole or in part, in the <em>U.S. Congressional Serial Set</em> between the joint publishing years of 1817 and 1827.  An additional nine instrument arrays were not counted in his tally of materials available in both of these references, or that appeared only in the <em>American State Papers</em>.  This study examines <em>Serial Set</em> volumes in these and in subsequent years through 1994.</p>

  <p align="left"><a href="http://treatiesportal.unl.edu/indigenous/"><img src="images/indigenous.jpg" alt="" width="60" height="70" border="2" class="imgright" /></a>Indigenous societies around the world are stepping forward to assert their place as an equal partner in their nation’s future.  In many cases, these efforts have been undertaken in response to the development and the 2007 publication of the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf">Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a>, as endorsed by the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations.  Governments also have begun to reconsider their stance on the associated issues.  The digital texts of 189 international constitutions – as offered by the <em><a href="https://www.constituteproject.org">Constitute</a></em> Web site – were examined for occurrences of the four tokens <em>indigenous</em>, <em>aboriginal</em>, and <em>Indian</em> or <em>Indians</em> to yield country indices.  Documents from forty countries were found to contain the term <em>indigenous</em> and seven possessed <em>aboriginal</em> (N uses = 320 and 19, respectively).  The more familiar token <em>Indian</em>, or its plural, occurred 88 times in ten of these political affirmations.</p>

This mandate was a clear continuation of the superintendency model employed by the British during their reign to develop trade and a strong relationship with the tribes.  The ordinance has been published over the ensuing years in various collations.  In the process, text errors were introduced.  Sixteen selected variants of this statement, from official as well as public sources, were compared with Levenshtein’s edit distance algorithm to assess similarity and provenance.</p>

  <p align="left"><a href="http://treatiesportal.unl.edu/paris1783/"><img src="images/paris1783.jpg" alt="" width="60" height="70" border="2" class="imgright" /></a>The texts of Article 2 of variants of the <em>Treaty of Paris, 1783</em> were examined to understand the provenance of two passages that deviated from the boundary parameters found in official British and American copies of this document.  Newspapers published in London, promptly brought to New York by the mail packet <em>Lord Hyde</em>, already exhibited the first fault.  Afterwards, it is clear that a New York paper introduced a second inconsistency into this Article.  The spread of these text mistakes into subsequent American renditions is discussed, as is the hypothesis that the British Foreign Office, in its initial distribution of the <em>Paris</em> text to London newspaper printers shortly after its arrival from the treaty negotiations, had induced the first text defect itself.</p>
